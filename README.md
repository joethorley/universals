`universals` provides common model-fitting S3 generic methods missing
from base R and the [`generics`](https://github.com/r-lib/generics)
package to reduce package dependencies and conflicts.

## Installation

<!-- To install the latest release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) -->

To install the developmental version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/universals)

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/universals")
```

To install the latest developmental release from the Poisson drat
[repository](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/drat)

``` r
# install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("poissonconsulting")
install.packages("universals")
```

## Usage

`universals` is designed to be used by package developers.

As with [`generics`](https://github.com/r-lib/generics) it is
recommended to import and re-export the generics of interest. For
example, to provide a method for the S3 `pars()` method, use the
following `roxygen2` code:

``` r
#' @importFrom universals pars
#' @export
universals::pars
```

## Inspiration

The `universals` package is heavily inspired by the
[`generics`](https://github.com/r-lib/generics) package.

Itâ€™s possible that some of the methods migrate to that package in a
future release.
